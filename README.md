HWs of Video Streaming and Tracking 2023 Fall NYCU  
## HW1
In this assignment, you will practice constructing a neural network using PyTorch and training it to perform a classification task.   
To ensure that students can meet the assignment's requirements, the use of pretrained weights and existing models, such as those built with torchvision, is not permitted.
## HW2
• Train a neural network to do detection on our own dataset  
• Model: object detection algorithms  
• YOLOX (we use the official code to set the baseline)  
• Add SE module to your network  
• Framework: PyTorch  
## HW3
• Implement visual multiple object tracking on videos.  
• Using detection model + Hungarian algorithm.  
• Calculate the total number of people appearing in the video.  
• Output the tracking result video and the count result.  
## HW4
You are asked to build a Live Streaming Server and perform tasks using deep learning model.
